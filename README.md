*A browser-based operating system written entirely in JavaScript.*

## About

Someone I know made something called [vOS](https://vos.codexcore.com/). I liked the idea, and wanted to make my own. I didn's steal any code, xOS is entirely written by me, from scratch, in JavaScript. I used another library, [X](https://github.com/thexproject/x/) quite a lot in the construction of xOS, and I added a lot of features to it that were needed for xOS.

## Improvements

xOS is still in development, and there is a lot to get done. The below list is primarily for me, but feel free to submit a PR or Issue!

- Better resizing and moving of windows
- Styles for more elements such as form elements
- Console
